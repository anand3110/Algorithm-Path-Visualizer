# Algorithm Path Visualizer 
[Live Demo](https://path-explorer.netlify.app)  

## Overview  
**Algorithm-Path-Visualizer** is an interactive web application built with pure JavaScript that visualizes different pathfinding algorithms. It allows users to create custom mazes, observe how algorithms operate, and gain a clearer understanding of pathfinding processes in real-time.  

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Interface**
  - Easily draw walls and define start/end points.
  - Design custom mazes or generate random ones instantly.

- **Algorithm Demonstration**
  - Visualizes the step-by-step execution of:
    - Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm
    - A* (A-Star) Algorithm
    - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    - Depth-First Search (DFS)
    - Bi-Directional BFS
    - Greedy Best-first Search

- **Customizable Experience**
  - Adjust animation speed for better learning and observation.
  - Watch how algorithms handle obstacles and find optimal paths.

- **Responsive & Lightweight**
  - Optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers.
  - Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for fast performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Logic**: JavaScript for algorithm implementation and dynamic grid rendering
